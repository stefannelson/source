# Year of Connection

Ahahahahaha. So that didn't work in the way I thought. Here's how it did: Erin. I think I became a much better partner to her stuck in quarantine, giving her reassurance that everything will be okay. In that way, I strengthened some connections that I already had. At the same time, hanging out with Sarah was good too. Besides that though, nah. COVID really hit this one hard. 

## 1. Year in Review 
We'll start with the outline of the year:
### Jan
* Went to Hawaii which was AMAZING. I'm so happy that I got to share that experience with Erin.
* I got back just in time (thank you flight delays) to begin teaching my two classes. I remember 091 in particular felt like peak teaching for myself. People were collaborating, lectures came out naturally.

### Feb
* Did a lot of grant writing with Sheryl, Michelle, and Sarah this month. Looking back, did not get a lot of them... welp.
* We Love STEM Night! is one of my proudest accomplishments. With a ton of coordination on my and Sheryl's end, we filled up the school with activities for the students. It was frantic, but I felt in my element. Such a good memory.

### March
* Did my first software interview (developing QIME2 at an NAU Bioinformatics lab). The interview went well and they definitely liked me, but didn't get the position. In some ways, a blessing in disguise.
* Starting up game nights with Will and Jaime again which was a wonderful way to escape the chaos of life and spend time with friends.
* COVID-19. Heck. Right away, I transitioned my students to online learning, learned how to use OBS, and kept on trucking. While not perfect, I'm proud of what I accomplished.

### April
* Stayed pretty normal. Worked more on grants, taught my class, etc. etc. I extended my service term with VISTA during the pandemic which I am eternally grateful to Lee and Ramsay for.
* When it was beginning to look like we were in this pandemic for the long haul (why was there even hope?), Erin and I did a variety of movie and game nights each week with Astronomy and Moorhead peeps.
* Talked with Andy a lot more which was very needed.

### May
* Facilitated finals for my courses and wrapped up teaching for the year. 
* GOT MY FRIGGIN' GRAD SCHOOL OFFER LETTER FINALLY.

### June
* Started up D&D again with Erin as the DM. 
* Got a local volunteer award alongside two other VISTA colleagues. 
* Interviewed for a Middle School math teacher position at the Flagstaff Arts and Leadership Academy, mostly for the experience. Didn't get it, but was close! 


### July
* Attended a Math Boot Camp meeting for CCC that panned out in $100 in cash. Yooo. 
* Got the first(?) grant for LinuxCorps at Killip!

### August
* Started grad school! Started learning about NTRU, struggling through number theory, and getting into a groove again.
* Learned about and began implementing Zettelkasten. Has become to form this directory (called the Source Code as of this writing) which is a space for me to learn and reflect by writing. 
* Went back to counseling, which has become super helpful as I and many others are struggling right now.

### Sept
* Had my first exam in a while.. didn't go great but it all worked out in the end.
* Had my only in person interaction with anyone in my department during the SICCS ice cream social. 
* Began going to Lake Mary with Erin more often as a means to relax, swim, etc.
* Had Goal-Oriented appointments with Hannah N. which was a great way to work through what needed to happen in my life to succeed in grad school. 
* Picked up laptop at NAU property surplus to help with computer donations at Killip. 

### Oct
* Socially distanced pumpkin carving with Astro folks was a great time!
* Took our engagement photos with Michelle! 
* Did the second math exam.. woof.

### Nov
* Helped Erin prepare for quals which she passed!!
* Had a dummy stressful finals week where I presented multiple presentations and completed 20+ proofs for math while writing a research paper on Coding Theory. Just, awful.
* Began the drive back home!

### Dec
* Submitted my portion for a paper written about PUFs in the PQC group. 
* Afterwards, just relaxing in MN. :) 
* Drove back, bought an antenna, celebrated the new year!
