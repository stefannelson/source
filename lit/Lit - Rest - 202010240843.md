## Four Hours for Deliberate Practice
The common phrase of 10,000 hours to mastery is not the only requisite action we need to take:

> But that's wrong. It comes after 10,000 hours of deliberate practice, 12,500 hours of deliberate rest, and 30,000 hours of sleep.

This sums up to about a decade. Concentrated practice is not and should not be something that is forced. Athletics has had this right for ages now - true focus on consistent 1% improvement (see Atomic Habits) is an efficient use of time; **overdoing it leads to injury and burnout**. Limit work/practice to an amount that is recoverable "on a daily or weekly basis."

This, of course, drastically increases the time requirement. To help with this, you need to understand and constantly remind yourself of the purpose of doing it in the first place. It's not just to earn the "fat stacks" of cash, but to strengthen your **"personal and professional" identity**. 

For direct implementation, many of the greats took afternoon naps, either after a long four hours of deliberate work, or to split up sessions into morning and evening times. The afternoons were typically used for relaxing, talking/walking with friends, and exercise.
