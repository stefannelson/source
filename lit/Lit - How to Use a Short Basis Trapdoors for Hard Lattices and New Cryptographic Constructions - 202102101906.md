Our contributions include a new notion of emph{preimage sampleable} functions, simple and efficient \`\`hash-and-sign’’ digital signature schemes, and identity-based encryption.    A core technical component of our constructions is an efficient algorithm that, given a basis of an arbitrary lattice, samples lattice points from a emph{discrete Gaussian} probability distribution whose standard deviation is essentially the length of the longest Gram-Schmidt vector of the basis. A crucial security property is that the output distribution of the algorithm is oblivious to the particular geometry of the given basis.}, number={432}, author={Gentry, Craig and Peikert, Chris and Vaikuntanathan, Vinod}, year={2007} }
