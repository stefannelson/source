# "I Love Learning; I Hate School"
*Susan D. Blum*

> @book{Blum, title={I Love Learning; I Hate Schooly: An Anthropology of College}, ISBN={9781501703416}, publisher={Cornell University Press.}, author={Blum, Susan D} }

Blum approaches this book as seasoned faculty looking in at the current student perspective; specifically, how school and learning are fundamentally clashing actions due to external forces such like the need to find a job and the increasing need for certifications to fulfill that purpose. This leads to a snowball effect; getting a leg up in this world requires higher certifications, which is unsustainable on a societal level. The B.S. degree has become the new high school graduate, after all, and that trend will only continue.

The process of education has mutated into a game for many students (including myself on many occasions) - how can I get the highest return while minimalizing effort on my end. For example, much of what I learned in high school turned out to be irrelevant. [[Time is the most precious resource - 202012311800 | My time is more valuable than that. ]]

> #### Just as you can't cheat in learning to walk, so you would not be able to cheat in learning what you yourself have chosen. There would still be challenges in learning to master the norms of academic citation, laboratory skills, scientific concepts, and so on, but these would be educational matters for a motivated few, not drudgery for the many. 

This admittedly comes from a place of privilege, and thus becomes our duty to battle injustice as it appears in other peoples' lives.
