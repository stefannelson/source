---

1. Wake up early.

2. Ask: Am I using this technology, or [is it using me?](https://forge.medium.com/a-radical-guide-to-spending-less-time-on-your-phone-a5419b1538ee)

3. Forget about outcomes — focus on making [a little progress every day](https://forge.medium.com/all-you-need-are-a-few-small-wins-every-day-f1a6d2bf9fb3).

4. [Say no](https://ryanholiday.net/to-everyone-who-asks-for-just-a-little-of-your-time-heres-what-it-costs-to-say-yes/) (a lot).

5. [Read something](https://dailystoic.com/read) every day.

6. [Don’t watch TV news](https://ryanholiday.net/stop-watching-the-news/).

7. Comparison leads to unhappiness.

8. [Journal](https://dailystoic.com/journaling/).

9. Strenuous exercise every single day.

10. Character is fate.

11. Practice the [law of action](https://ryanholiday.net/law-of-attraction/), not attraction. Instead of envisioning the future you want, create it.

12. Get up when you fall/fail.

13. Prove your life’s philosophy with actions over words (and that’s not easy).

14. Don’t [argue with facts](https://forge.medium.com/there-are-only-hard-facts-and-harder-decisions-2c7b5efb076d) just because you don’t like them.

15. It’s not about routine but about [practice.](https://forge.medium.com/its-not-about-routine-but-about-practice-200a56c5505)

16. Forget credit. Do [the work](https://forge.medium.com/the-success-strategy-i-wish-i-could-give-my-younger-self-cd1ec47e0bdf).

17. Do a kindness each day.

18. Every situation “has [two handles](https://ryanholiday.net/two-handles/),” Epicurus said. Choose the one that allows you to see the meaning and good that can come out of suffering.

19. [Success = autonomy.](https://ryanholiday.net/autonomy/)

20. [Pick up trash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFJfDMTvOCY) when you see it.

21. If you want to be good and feel good, [you have to do good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4zGoRWXaaw). There is no escaping this.

22. Deliberately [think about death](https://dailystoic.com/memento-mori/). Every day.

23. “Trust the process.”

24. Do your job well, whatever it is. Because how you do anything is how [you do everything](https://ryanholiday.net/how-you-do-anything/).

25. There are two types of time: alive time and dead time. One is when you sit around and wait until things happen to you. The other is when you are in control, when you make every second count. Always choose [alive time.](https://humanparts.medium.com/will-you-choose-alive-time-or-dead-time-8d7b8ba212)

26. “What book has changed your life?” is a [question](https://ryanholiday.net/this-question-will-change-your-reading-life/) you should ask people you admire if you want to change your own life (as long as you read the book, that is).

27. There’s no such thing as “[quality time](https://forge.medium.com/theres-no-such-thing-as-quality-time-58db618c099d).” When you fixate on it, you miss the moments unfolding in front of you.

28. Instead of trying to be the noun, do the verb.

29. The best thing you can do for your work is [take a walk](https://forge.medium.com/the-best-thing-you-can-do-for-your-work-is-take-a-walk-cddf32fee7c6).

30. The present is enough.

31. You are what you [repeatedly do](https://dailystoic.com/we-are-what-we-repeatedly-do/).

32. Have a philosophy.

33. [Make time for philosophy](https://forge.medium.com/why-you-should-study-philosophy-47c53fbc3205).

33. Don’t just read — you must [read to lead](https://ryanholiday.net/read-to-lead/).

34. [Keep a commonplace book](https://ryanholiday.net/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/), a collection of little sayings about how to live.

35. [Stop looking for shortcuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRshzaxbJnI&t=82s). Do the work.

36. Build an “[inner citadel](https://ryanholiday.net/why-everybody-needs-an-inner-citadel/),” what the Stoics called that fortress inside all of us that no external adversity can ever break down.

37. Let it go — those who wrong you wrong themselves.

38. Spend time with old people.

39. When evaluating an opportunity, ask yourself: What will teach me the most?

40. Think purpose, not passion. (One is about you, the other about something bigger than you.)

41. Have [kids](https://dailydad.com/). Or just talk to kids. They can teach you something if you really pay attention.

42. But don’t use your kids as [props for validation](https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2016/11/heres-why-i-wont-be-exploiting-my-kids-on-social-media/).

43. Biographies are the best way to [study the lives of the greats](https://dailystoic.com/this-is-how-you-learn/).

44. Don’t try to beat other people — try to be the only one doing exactly what you’re doing.

45. Know why you do what you do.

46. Be strict with yourself and forgiving of others.

47. Practice the art of [negative visualization](https://dailystoic.com/premortem/).

48. [Cut toxic people](https://dailystoic.com/who-are-you-spending-time-with/) out of your life.

49. Before starting any project, have a [“draw-down period,”](https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2016/04/the-most-important-part-of-the-creative-process-that-everyone-misses-a-draw-down-period/) that phase when you step back, look at your idea, and ask: “What is this really going to be?”

50. As the late coach and business executive Bill Campbell said: “If you’ve been blessed, be a blessing.”

51. Don’t wait until later. Do the thing now.

52. Never go a day without some [deep work](https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2016/02/31-ways-to-get-more-deep-work-accomplished/).

53. Make time for a regular for [self-review](https://ryanholiday.net/the-most-important-thing-you-can-do-each-morning/). Examine how you spend your time and how you’re living up to your values.

54. Ask yourself: How does this action I’m about to take affect other people?

55. [Don’t take the money](https://dailystoic.com/dont-take-the-money-dont-take-the-money/) if it means sacrificing your autonomy.

56. Always stay a student.

57. [Break things down](https://ryanholiday.net/contemptuous-expressions/) to see what they really are.

61. Never recline your seat on an airplane. (See also: “How do my actions affect others?”)

62. Belief in yourself is overrated. Generate evidence_._

63. Don’t overthink the price on a book. [Buy it](https://dailystoic.com/the-one-purchase-that-pays-you-back/) if you think you’ll read it, and the purchase will pay you back.

64. Good things happen in [bookstores](https://medium.com/s/story/good-things-happen-in-book-stores-c446eae1e210).

65. See what you can learn from every person you meet — even people you don’t like.

66. Set a bedtime.

67. A successful marriage is worth more than a successful career.

68. “Go straight to the seat of intelligence.” — Marcus Aurelius

69. It’s human being, not human doing.

70. [Amor fati](https://dailystoic.com/amor-fati/). Love your fate. To me, that means taking control over the way you see the world.

71. [Go the f\*ck to sleep](https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2015/07/heres-your-productivity-hack-go-the-fck-to-sleep/).

72. “Always say less than necessary.” — Robert Greene

73. Never take a phone call sitting down. Go outside and go for a walk.

83. Don’t talk about projects until you’re finished.

84. To build resilience, go into [the wilderness](https://dailystoic.com/we-all-must-go-into-the-wilderness/).

85. Try to see opportunities where others see obstacles.

86. Focus on your [inner scorecard](https://medium.com/@RyanHoliday/how-good-do-you-want-to-be-9a2754fafd68) rather than your outer scorecard.

87. Have [hobbies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRL_MGaI6lE&t=211s) unrelated to your job.

88. You don’t solve problems by running away.
