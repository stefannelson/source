While 2020/2021 has been disastrous for a number of reasons, it allows for an opportunity to reflect on what really matters. In that way, priorities are even more important than they used to be, particularly those at the level of "values." This can mean family, friends, and yourself. As Dr. Pacheco-Vega writes: 

> You survived – RIGHT FUCKING ON.
> Your family survived – GLORY!
> Your friends, students, colleagues are doing as well as they can be? -EXCELLENT
> Anything else is the Cherry on Top.
