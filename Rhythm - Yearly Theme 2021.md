# 2021: The Year of Rhythm
"Rhythm" takes a couple of forms this year. In particular, I want to create a pattern of "go" then "rest," or "**inhale**" then "**exhale**." I want to not only work hard on the frankly excessive amounts of projects I have, but to separate the work I do with the life I lead. Both sides are of the same coin, and are equally important. I must always tell myself that.

Rhythm applies to my hobbies as well, both on- and off-screen. My time drumming, playing bass, or watching/reading is sacred. They shouldn't be sacrificed, as there isn't anything that would be the end of the world if I need to delay it for work. [[Lit - Time Off - 202102051316 | Time off is important]] and [[Time is the most precious resource - 202012311800]]. I want to revitalize the previous year's theme (connection) at this time as well. Especially once COVID becomes bearable, spending time with others is sacred. 

To juggle my multiple projects, the idea of [[Slow-Motion Multitasking - 202102051312 | slow-motion multitasking]] is vital. 

Somewhat unrelated to the theme, I want to work through my backlog this year; appreciate what I have and not attempt to collect, build up more things. So,
