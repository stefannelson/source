# 2021: The Year of Rhythm
"Rhythm" takes a couple of forms this year. In particular, I want to create a pattern of "go" then "rest," or "**inhale**" then "**exhale**." I want to not only work hard on the frankly excessive amounts of projects I have, but to separate the work I do with the life I lead. Both sides are of the same coin, and are equally important. I must always tell myself that.

> # When playing music, rests are just as important as the notes you play. 

Rhythm applies to my hobbies as well, both on- and off-screen. My time drumming, playing bass, or watching/reading is sacred. They shouldn't be sacrificed, as there isn't anything that would be the end of the world if I need to delay it for work. [[Lit - Time Off - 202102051316 | Time off is important]] and [[Time is the most precious resource - 202012311800]]. I want to revitalize the previous year's theme (connection) at this time as well. Especially once COVID becomes bearable, spending time with others is sacred. 

To juggle my multiple projects, the idea of [[Slow-Motion Multitasking - 202102051312 | slow-motion multitasking]] is vital. 

Somewhat unrelated to the theme, I want to work through my backlog this year; appreciate what I have and not attempt to collect, build up more things. So, 
* No new video game purchases.

Okay, I actually don't really know what I want next year to look like, so I figured writing a bunch would help my mind figure it out. Additionally, a good time to reflect on the past couple of years.
* 2019: Year of **Rebirth**. I think this was such a good direction to take. I was unemployed and at probably the lowest point of my life thus far. It really did feel like all I had in life was Erin while everything else was a smoldering mess. Rebirth was, in effect, get your shit together. I ended the year with two jobs that I loved in education and even set the groundwork for grad school because I knew VISTA was temporary. I ended the year running a large event bringing computer science professionals to Killip. 
* 2020: Year of **Connection**. Ahahahahaha. So that didn't work in the way I thought. Here's how it did: Erin. I think I became a much better partner to her stuck in quarantine, giving her reassurance that everything will be okay. In that way, I strengthened some connections that I already had. At the same time, hanging out with Sarah was good too. Besides that though, nah. COVID really hit this one hard. 



Here are some projects that I will be continuing/starting in 2021:
1. Grad Program - taking two semesters of classes that include modeling infectious diseases, hardware in cybersecurity, and data science. Also researching:
	1. Post-Quantum Cryptography
	2. Computer Science for All @ Killip
2. Wedding planning w/ Erin. A lot of it will be delegating groom's dinner and working on music/activity scheduling and invitations. Venue and food are on their way 
3. Teaching my CCC class(es). 4 credits/semester. Hopefully MAT 091 to reuse resources. 
4. LinuxCorps @ Killip. Coordinating volunteers, running the club one day/week.
