#math/cryptography 

Falcon is an [[NTRU Lattices - 202008281320 | NTRU lattice]]-based implementation of the GPV Framework. That is,

1. Take the public key as: a long basis for a $q$-ary lattice (NTRU lattice specifically).
2. Take the private key as: a short basis of the same lattice. #TODO 
3. Signing: 
	1. Generate `salt` randomly #TODO 
	2. Utilize a hash function H to calculate $c = H(\text{msg||salt})$, where $c$ is a random-looking point on the lattice/grid.
	3. Utilize [[Lit - Fast Fourier Orthogonalization - 202102101933]] to find $v$, a lattice point "close" to $c$. 
	4. Return the tuple (`salt`, $s=c-v$).
4. Verification: tuple is valid $\iff$
	1. $s$ is "short,"
	2. $H(\text{msg||salt})-s$ is a point on the lattice generated by the public key.
