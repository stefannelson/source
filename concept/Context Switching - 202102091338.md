# Context Switching
#productivity #computer-science 

In computing, context switching is how multiple processes are run simultaneously. Without parallel computing, each task is run on a single processor. In this way, it's ideal to compare to a human doing tasks. Humans are obviously not nearly as good at it. 

For humans, multitasking has a significant cost in the form of time and focus/attention. If you switch from homework in math to writing a humanities paper, some time for adjustment is definitely needed! This time would only get marginally better (per switch) if you continually switch tasks, to the point where it's not worth it. As a result, to maximize productivity, it's worth putting your undivided attention to one singular task. For example, writing this entry is all I'm ideally thinking about (although the lure of Twitter is definitely there).

> Context switches are usually computationally intensive, and much of the design of operating systems is to optimize the use of context switches.

This is the foundational basis for the idea of [[Slow-Motion Multitasking - 202102051312 | slow-motion multitasking]], where projects are switched only when the proper amount of time is given to them. That is, if you hit a wall, you can switch to a different project. This idea leverages efficient task switching alongside our ability to ruminate on problems unconsciously.
