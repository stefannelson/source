An $n$-dimensional lattice $\mathcal{L}$ is any subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ that is both:
1. An additive [[Groups - 202009291317#^654c3a | subgroup]]: $0 \in \mathcal{L}$, and for all $x,y \in \mathcal{L}$, we have that $-x,x+y \in \mathcal{L}$. 
2. Discrete: For every $x \in \mathcal{L}$, there exists a neighborhood in $\mathbb{R}^n$ in which $x$ is the only lattice point. This means that there is some minimum distance between elements of a lattice.

Lattices are generated by linearly independent vectors $b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n \in \mathbb{R}^m$ where $n$ is the **rank** of the lattice and $m$ is the **dimension**. We want our lattice to be full-rank; that is, when $m=n$. Then, the lattice is constructed as
$$\mathcal{L}(b_1,\ldots,b_n) = \left\{\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_ib_i \mid x_i \in \mathbb{Z}\right\}.$$

Lattices are generated by more than one basis, which means that finding a particular lattice point can vary greatly between what basis vectors are used in conjunction with each other. 

> For example, the set of vectors $\{(0,1),(1,0)\}$ and $\{(1,2),(2,3)\}$ both generate the lattice $\mathbb{R}^2$. However, getting to the point $(7,9)$ requires drastically different values for their linear combinations. 

Bases that are shorter and more orthogonal make it easier to get to certain points (like the first basis in the above example), while longer and less orthogonal are more difficult. These are classified as short and long bases respectively, shown in the figure below:

This makes problems such as the [[Shortest and Closest Vector Problems - SVT & CVT - 202008271210]] much more feasible to use for public key cryptosystems.
