# Focusing on the Future Brings Anxiety, The Past brings Depression
#mental-health 

Looking towards the future and reflecting on the past are vital for motivating and improving oneself, but a focus on either can lead to consequences. 

Constantly looking into the past can bring a depressing mindset to the present day (particularly during a pandemic). Being highly future-oriented can bring anxieties. 

> What if I'm not good enough? 
> What if I'm not progressing enough now? Will my future be compromised? 

The best way to combat this is through defaulting your mind to the present. While every day is connected, limiting scope to day by day allows for mindfulness in what is going on around you, as well as keeping depression and anxiety at bay. 

That said, it's definitely not a switch that can be turned on and off. [[Learning is Continuous - 202008271211]] and developing this habit takes time.
