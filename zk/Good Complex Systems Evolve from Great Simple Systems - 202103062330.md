# Gall's Law: Complex Systems Evolve from Simple Systems
#productivity #writing 

To create a complex system, starting with a proven simple system first and branching off from that is essential. While the idea is simple, it expands to many different areas.

## Habits
From personal experience, it's really hard to adopt a new way of doing work from scratch. I've tried GTD, Kanban boards, etc. to no avail, and a lot of the reason is that I bit off more than I could chew with a full system. A better approach came later; start with a simple idea (make list of things to do, mark them off, and review at the end of the week) and expand from there. [[Study, Create, Repeat - 202009022147]]

## World Building
The idea that [[Character, Plot, then World Building - 202103062336 | worldbuilding should serve the characters and plot of a story first]] is a analogue to this idea. With a solid foundation of characters, iteractions, and the story that revolves around that, the world around these characters can be built off of that foundation.
