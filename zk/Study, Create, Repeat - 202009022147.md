# The Generation Effect 
#productivity 

Actively generating content based on something you're learning is immensely valuable. [[Learning is Continuous - 202008271211]] and a strong way to [[Learn and Work in Public - 202009262228]]. To quote Cunff, the Generation Effect is 

> ## the phenomenon where information is better remembered if it is actively created from oneâ€™s own mind rather than simply read in a passive way.

This is why art is valuable in STE(A)M - creation breeds innovation, and new ideas can form from this continuous loop. The Zettlekasten idea in in of itself is an example of this as well- research, write, repeat. [[Writing and Research should be Separate but Linked - 202008271249]]. The act of summarizing in your own words creates opportunities to engage with the material, including connecting it with things you already know. This is the whole basis of the Feynman technique, after all! It only makes sense to add some pressure to the situation. 

Some ideas on how to "create" in this manner are the following:
- Teach the topic, either to an imaginary audience or real life one.
- Develop your topic into a story to make it more engaging to yourself and your audience.
- Make yourself accountable. Learn in public, either by publishing your work (blog or video) and/or putting yourself in a public space (irl or virtual) to prevent procrastination.
