# Balance Self-Care with Self-Avoidance
#psychology #mental-health 

Activities that allow for distancing from what is stressful in our lives is vital. Constant vigilance and constant thinking about the problems we have can lead to burnout incredibly quickly. 

That being said, activities that may start as a way to cope/distance oneself can lead to spending too much time on that thing. This can lead to burnout in a very different way: self-avoidance and the overwhelm that comes with it. 

Discipline is needed to keep this balance, and is something to be mindful of. This can work well during a weekly review - pay attention to how much time you're spending on self-care, and see if there's a point where it stops being effective and just becomes a way to procrastinate.
