# Math $\equiv$ Writing
#math/education

The way math education has transformed over the years has direct connections to how writing has been taught since the beginning, to the point where they can (and maybe should) become indistinguishable. Here are some parallels that already exist (Su):

1. Both involve reasoning and making convincing arguments.
2. Both involve creative choices about what arguments are most compelling.
3. Both cause anxiety among some people.
4. Everyone can improve with practice and encouragement.
5. Both benefit from mastering technical skills as well as cultivating an overarching vision.
6. It is unreasonable to expect an argument to pop out beautifully the first time.
7. More often, getting good involves a process of repeated revision and creative choices to make arguments clearer and more compelling.
8. Doing them well can bring great personal satisfaction.
9. Clarity of communication is essential, and intertwined with clear thinking.
10. Both build virtues that will serve you well no matter what you do in life. 

## Math Education - Rebranded

In my schooling experience, I was encouraged the get the right answer quickly rather than understanding the problems well enough to the point of being able to explain it on a dime. Memorization and direct computation were key here. 

> Of course, this is exactly the opposite of what learning math should be. Thinking is everything in mathematics. Thinking is where joy is to be found, when you truly grasp an idea and understand it. The process of learning is just that: a process. To grasp an idea is to start with an unfinished, possibly incomplete, understanding and, through exploring more and more examples gradually understand it better and better. 

The concept of how to teach writing starts on the concept of a draft. The first go-around will not be perfect, and that's okay - expected even! An openess to sharing ideas and feedback while expelling the notion of perfectionism until far later on in the process is how good ideas become great. 

## Research Mindset

This way of approaching how math and STEM in general is taught accurately reflects how research in the fields themselves are done. Nobody should expect 100% understanding from the get-go, learning takes time! Feedback and collaboration should never be underestimated. From Su: 

> When I am doing research, I start with an incomplete picture---a guess, a conjecture about something I've noticed. Then I explore more and more---doing examples, trying to reason about why something might be true, until I arrive at a more complete picture of an idea.  Moreover, that picture is always being revised as I learn related ideas and place this idea in context.  If this is really how math is done, then why isn't it taught that way at every level?

From a personal perspective, my experience with teaching MAT 114 at NAU had many glimpses of what NOT to do in this regard. Jansen recommends having students use whatever language for the concepts that they're comfortable with, while students must use the correct terminology - even in a higher ed class!

## Class Implementation

Some ideas that Su has can be directly placed into my CCC classes. 

> Award partial credit on homework problems when students suggest strategies, even if they are not ultimately able to solve the problem.
> Publicly affirm any student that offers an idea in class, and build upon it.  In almost any 'wrong' idea there is some right idea that you can build upon to solve the problem. Or, you can pursue the idea, and then discuss what you learn by going down that path---perhaps it is an insight that affirms that this approach will not work. You are inviting students to see how you take a 'rough draft' idea and learn from it, inviting conversation about it. This may mean abandoning what you planned to do in class in favor of going down a path that a student has suggested.
> Encourage students to openly discuss with other students strategies they tried to solve a problem that did not work.  
> Discuss your own rough draft ideas with your students.  For instance, you might openly discuss in class your own journey to understand a concept: "when I first learned concept X, I used to think that it meant y. After a while I began to realize that Y was not sufficient to capture the idea, because of this example."  Or, you might explain a research problem you are working on, and how some of the ideas you are thinking about are still in rough draft form.
> Before presenting the proof of a theorem or a solution to a problem, invite student discussion to generate ideas about how it could be proved.  
> Give students opportunities to revise their work for a higher grade.  
> Incorporate peer feedback in your course. For instance, have students swap homework assignments, and offer helpful critique on how to improve each other's writing. You should coach students on what good feedback looks like. 
> Design a final project in which a student takes some bit of work they've done earlier in the semester and revises at the end of the semester.  For instance, they could choose a solution to one of a selection of difficult homework exercises. In addition, ask them to offer a reflection on how they've grown in their thinking and communication.
