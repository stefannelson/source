# Learning and Working in Public
#productivity #psychology 

Blogs. Pushing Github code. Tracking hours. Methodologies like these are useful for various different reason, but they all contribute to a specific goal - applying the generation effect to [[Study, Create, Repeat - 202009022147]]. This workflow is expedited by the idea of working/learning in public. 

Public code, writing, etc. creates an implicit system of accountability. Creating content that can give recognition is motivating beyond belief (it's a huge reason that social media has become so important in our society). This makes for an excellent framework for learning outside of an educational environment or work (and even in it!). 

Of course, it's an adjustment:
> “Learning in Public” is scary for many reasons – people can find and cling to outdated information and users are exposing their knowledge during a vulnerable time in the project (i.e. when they don’t yet have all the answers). However, during this part of the process is when learning can be most valuable. If you share what you know and what you don’t know in the middle of a project, you give people an opportunity to share specific knowledge that can help you in the moment. If it works, this can help save time and money.

Additionally, learning in public is also a mindset shift to building to public. They are synonymous Applying what was learned to something, be it a python implementation, a write-up, or something else does a couple of useful things (per Anne-Laure Le Cunff):
1. Applying knowledge is vital to grappling and understanding the concept. This has connections to the shift in Project-Based Learning (PBL) in education. 
2. A chronological list of projects gives a metric for how learning has gone over the short or long term. 

> The best way to truly understand anything is to use the generation effect: to produce your own content, in your own words, and to share it with the world to create a feedback loop.
