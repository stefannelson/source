# Identity/Habit Harmony

To [[Build your Impenetrable Fortress - 202009230843]], habits must be formed. To create these, it's important to ask yourself **who you are**. Are you a runner, a coder, a teacher, a musician? If so, what you're struggling with is okay - it's part of the territory. If you don't run your 1 mile/day, that's just a negative vote - all you need is the majority to consider yourself as part of the identity. 

> Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity What you do is an indication of the type of person you believe that you are - Either consciously or unconsciously. 
> -James Clear

One's identity is the main determinant of succeeding or failing a habit, and creating evidence of having that identity is a feedback loop that will keep getting stronger and stronger. 

> So, if you wanna run that 5k someday, take a second to think about the kind of person who might do that sort of thing automatically, or naturally. That person would be a runner or an athlete. Then, whenever an opportunity to reinforce that identity in yourself comes up, ask yourself, "What would a runner do in this situation?" Eventually by acting like a runner, you become one. 
> -Thomas Frank

An application for this can be with committing to side-projects and hobbies. If you identify in the role you want to become, **the priority of that activity spikes**.

Never let failure become a habit on its own.
