# Slow-Motion Multitasking 
#productivity #mental-health 

Traditional multitasking is garbage. As authors such as Newport write, what appears to be juggling multiple things at once is just context switching really quickly (either on purpose or through interruptions). This can take one out of the concentrated state they were in and lead to a net loss of productivity. Depending on the tasks at hand, this can have awful repercussions to one's mental health - "why am I getting nothing done?"

At the same time, a hermit-like focus on one thing isn't the answer either. Going completely depth-first into a topic leads to hitting a wall. While persevering through this hurdle is sometimes necessary (e.g. running a marathon), banging your head against the wall isn't helpful for anybody.

Both approaches have been amazing for the "distraction economy" with social media. It slots in particularly well with those who find "multitasking" exilerating, but can also serve to an enticing way to escape a hermit-like struggle of a particular idea - "this is too hard, but social media is my escape."

The idea of "Slow-Motion Multitasking" leads to a combination of the best aspects of work and play. tldr;

> ## Have multiple passions, and you'll always have something to play with.

Harford gives Charles Darwin as an example of this. Initially interested in Zoology and Geology, the questions he asked lead him to different areas of study that included evolution, earthworms, and development of human children. 

> ## When playing music, rests are just as important as the notes you play. 

Darwin spent years of his life hopping back and forth between these passions as he was motivated to work on them. In many ways, these projects were an alternate path to banging your head against the wall indefinitely on one problem. Switching to another not only keeps flow going (good for the mental health) but as [[Lit - Time Off - 202102051316 | Frenzel and Fitch]] explain, allows ideas and creativity to incubate.

These "projects" are not just work, they can (and should!) be hobbies as well!

## Mental Crop Rotation

A farmer doesn't grow the same thing in the same place over and over again. Rather, they rotate their crops so as to not drain the soil of its nutrients. This leads to a higher and more consistent yield every year. 

> ## Like crops, focuses/projects/ideas should be rotated.

While crops reduce nutrients until they are replenished, projects drain energy until an opportunity to replenish your mental load shows up. If this is not done, it leads to **burnout**.
