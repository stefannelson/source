# Writing a Result is Cooking a Meal
#writing #productivity 

I have been building a Zettelkasten/Evergreen notes system, where [[Learning is Continuous - 202008271211]] and [[These Notes should be Atomic - 202008271243]]. This is a tool particularly suited for storing knowledge for the express purpose on creating new ideas and connections. [[Writing and Research should be Separate but Linked - 202008271249]] and a great visual for this process is to think of writing as cooking.

In cooking, you need ingredients, and these are these atomic notes that have been built. From this perspective, **writer's block is simply not having enough ingredients on hand**. What to do in this case? Get more ingredients! Cultivate your garden to procure the ingredients you need to create. Eventually, you will produce "fruit" to share with the world. This is the essence of the research/writing process.
