Science, and by extension learning in general, is continuous. There will always be more to discover about a particular topic, and that's its biggest benefit. 

It is vital to remember this mindset when thinking about results of any sort. While this may date this note, what the world understands about COVID-19 right now is likely so much smaller than what will be known a few months from now. Work is always being done, and therefore new discoveries are always being made.
