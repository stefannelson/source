# Assessment in Education as a Cybersecurity Problem
#idea #math/cryptography #math/education 

A mechanism of the education space/industry that has been absolutely intolerable as I have been in this profession is assessment. As the COVID-19 pandemic rampages through the U.S., the rise of software such as Proctorio has taken the already-existing accusations of the policing of students up to a whole new level. 

There have been [articles](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21526792/proctorio-online-test-proctoring-lawsuit-universities-students-coronavirus) describing the pressures and [emotional harm](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/style/testing-schools-proctorio.html) students face when being tested under the watchful, automated eye of this software. My place of employment still encouraged its use. Such controversies inspire the belief that there has to be a better way, and it's possible cybersecurity may have an answer. 

Unfortunately, I will need to leave this as #TODO . Much of the literature that I have seen thus far has been advocating for something like Proctorio and others, rather than replacing them. That is, cybersecurity has been applied in more traditional contexts such as analyzing student environments through video/audio feeds, which I hope to eliminate. It's a hard problem, and I want to come back to this.
