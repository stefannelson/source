# Be Grateful, it Could Happen to You
#mental-health 

Something that should be avoided at all costs is something bad taking you off guard. Thinking that you are invincible from the hardships of the world is dangerous - be realistic. This feeling can be grounding and really shows where your place in society is at the time. Donating to charity isn't just to boost your ego, but to understand that life can put you in the same situation as those who need it **in an instant**. 

Be prepared, but don't let hopelessness consume you. Be grateful.
