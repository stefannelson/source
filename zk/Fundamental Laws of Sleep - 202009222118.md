# Fundamental Laws of Sleep
#mental-health #psychology #productivity 

At the time of this writing, I am on a journey of sorts to figure out how to get the best sleep possible. These thoughts follow after a discussion with a therapist/behavioral scientist that I spoke with. 

1. Avoid caffeine before going to bed by $\approx$ 6-8 hours. The sleep disruption caused by tea/coffee is not worth the benefits gained.
2. While exercise is important, avoid high energy activities 2 hours before bed. While sleep quality may stay the same, the ability to fall asleep in the first place would be effected. 
3. An environment for quality sleep includes a moderate, perhaps slightly colder room temp, as quiet as possible, and dark. 
4. A balance should be struck with food. Don't be starved when going to bed if possible, but finish the last meal 2-3 hours prior to sleep. 
5. Naps screw so many things up. If naps must be had, have it before 3pm for 15-20 min maximum. 
6. Create a night routine an hour before bed to unwind. This can look like reading books, tea drinking, listening to music, showering, journaling, etc. Electronics should be put away if possible. 
7. A good routine shouldn't be on a schedule per say - it should be 100% integrated. Same wake-up, same bed-time, every single day.
