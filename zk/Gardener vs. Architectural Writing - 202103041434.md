# Gardener vs. Architectural Writing
#writing #psychology 

There can be considered to be two schools of thought when it comes to organizing one's writing, and an oversimplified view of this is structured vs. unstructured. 

For **discovery** writing (e.g. Steven King), you develop the characters and events organically as you write. A state of flow and a roleplaying incredibly valued here. Characters and the interactions they have benefit from organic communication, and a rigid structure can hinder this outcome. That said, the plot could suffer if that's what is important to the story being told. That is, ideas may not synergize super well.

On the other hand, **architectural** writing (e.g. Orson Scott Card) is systematic. Every character, every plot point is outlined. This gives the opportunity for a story to have payoffs built up over the long haul of the story being told - foreshadowing can occur, plot points can resolve and intersect in satisfying ways.

What authors like Sanderson recommend is to combine the two in a way that works with how you write and tell stories. A particularly interesting anecdote was an author who develops their characters first by monologing as them. In this way, they are telling you (the author) who they are and what they're about. From there, structure can be added in!

A system like `sourcecode` can be helpful here, as [[Writing is Cooking - 202009230817 | writing is cooking]].
