# Context-Sharing Habits
#productivity

There are many distinct ways to make small, meaningful habits work and stick.

Some quick review - the cycle of the average habit consists of a cue, facilitating a craving that leads to you doing the thing. Afterwards, there is a reward, either tangible or something as simple as feeling good. 

If habits share the same context, such as quick things that need to be driven to, doing them all at the same time can be easier on the mind. Completing tasks in a linear fashion means a ton of mindset shifts that end up slowing us down. Changing the order of what gets done when allows for the removal of this mindset shift. 

**Examples**
* Running errands all in one go
* Checking mail during a laundry run
