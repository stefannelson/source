There are many distinct ways to make small, meaningful habits work and stick.

Some quick review - the cycle of the average habit consists of a cue, facilitating a craving that leads to you doing the thing. Afterwards, there is a reward, either tangible or something as simple as feeling good. 

Training newer, maybe less appealing habits to be done with more established ones is an excellent option to motivate the cultivation of new habits. Having a bad habit like sleeping in or going back to bed (I had trouble with this around 8-15-2020) doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing, and could in fact be used to your advantage. If a more unappealing habit (like getting back into running) needs to be done, allow that bad habit to be a **reward** for completing that habit. 

Effectively, you're just utilizing the transitive property - the reward for the bad habit becomes the cue for another habit. Definitely use discretion - some/most bad habits are worth breaking. Thankfully, this works for any type of habit. ;)
