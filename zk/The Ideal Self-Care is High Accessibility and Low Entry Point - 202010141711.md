# The Components of Good Self Care
#psychology #mental-health 

[[Self-Care with Self-Avoidance is a Delicate Balance - 202010141703]]. Some revitalizing activities take a significant amount of time, be it from travel, preparation beforehand (blowing up an inflatable kayak), and required activities after the fact (showering). For many self-care activities, these are unavoidable - many people who enjoy these activities either enjoy or just tolerate the extra pre/post-requisite parts.

This creates an ideal in my personal life - self-care that is minimal effort to begin and end. As described in [[Habit Bundling - 202008271241]], habits live and die by the cues in our environment. If an environment is designed to facilitate the habit (keeping a french press washed, coffee beans near the grinder, etc.), that habit is accessible whenever it's needed. **Destroying resistance for self-care activities is vital**.  

Another component of ideal self-care is the satisfaction gained from it. There is something to be said about getting better and better at a skill - a high skill ceiling leads to a high rate of satisfaction. However, skill vs. enjoyment is has a valley; a point where the struggle is unenjoyable. While temporary most of the time, this may not always make for good self-care. It's therefore important to have activities on speed dial that can be enjoyed regardless. 

If you don't mind bad coffee, there is a low risk for not enjoying your coffee making experience.
