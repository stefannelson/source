# World Building Should Only Serve Character
#writing 

As Sanderson said, the ideal takeaway of your reader should be something like this:

> ## "Wow, this story and these characters are so fascinating! Oh and by the way I know a bunch about Hogwarts now." 

Boring writeup/encyclopedia entries is something to be avoided. This should be implemented into the story instead (via dialogue) only when it can work organically. That said, it's worth thinking in the shoes of those who live in the world you're creating - would they really ask questions that could lead to a huge exposition dump? Probably not, because it's normal in their world! It's a delicate balance to preserve that suspension of disbelief.
