# Sleep is Vital for Learning
#psychology #productivity #mental-health 

In a world where [[Learning is Continuous - 202008271211]], it is vital to develop habits that facilitate not just the learning process, but one's well being in general. Sleep does just that. While we are awake, the hippocampus of the brain collects all sorts of short-term memories, including facts and perhaps their corresponding connections. Imprinting these in our memory is aided immensely by sleep, and most importantly **allows the hippocampus to replenish itself**. It is very much a "file transfer mechanism."

Sleep during the day has been shown to fight against the tendency to become worse at learning as time without sleep goes on, up to a 20% increased capacity as described by Walker.  

Following learning, it's important to sleep well afterwards as well in order for these ideas to consolidate. In particular, the connections made between ideas learned to themselves and previously learned concepts is vital. A particularly interesting benefit is that memories that were thought to be lost could resurface after sleeping. People who say sleeping on a problem weren't messing around. 

Obviously, the reverse of these concepts are true too - not sleeping can be actively harmful to memory and the learning process at large. It is of utmost importance to keep a routine that respects the hours needed for sleep.

Insufficient sleep is a key lifestyle factor determining whether or not you will develop Alzheimer’s disease. Inadequate sleep—even moderate reductions for just one week— disrupts blood sugar levels so profoundly that you would be classified as pre-diabetic. Short sleeping increases the likelihood of your coronary arteries becoming blocked and brittle, setting you on a path toward cardiovascular disease, stroke, and congestive heart failure. Fitting Charlotte Brontë’s prophetic wisdom that “a ruffled mind makes a restless pillow,” sleep disruption further contributes to all major psychiatric conditions, including depression, anxiety, and suicidality.
