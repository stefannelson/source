# Atomic Notes
#productivity 

This is the basis and goal for all of the relevant notes in this repo. Atomic/Evergreen notes should be:
* about one thing and ONLY about that one thing
* concept-oriented
* densely linked, as [[Learning is Continuous - 202008271211]]. Also known as preferring "associative ontologies."

Zettels are for **gardeners**, compared to "librarians" or "architects". 

These notes do not and should not follow a hierarchy set up at the beginning: rather, the structure builds itself through links as seen above. Eventually, as these more of these notes are created, the nodes/connections made between each of them will be incredibly useful. 

Just like with graphs in mathematics, there will be multiple ways to navigate a graph, especially when the number of nodes in that graph is particularly large. This means that even the act of navigating through these self-contained, densely-linked notes can be done in multiple different ways. During each of these ways, new ideas/connections can be formed, which allows for a system that actively encourages [networked thought.](https://nesslabs.com/roam-research)

Perhaps most usefully, making notes atomic **inherently makes one extract key ideas from the source they are based from**, making them "mobile" as Lawson describes. The information is distilled in a way understandable to myself and one level removed from the source it's based on, allowing for easier synthesis with other pieces of information. 

Every time you write a new note, make sure to go back to previous notes and to interlink them together. This is where mastery comes from. As Sun Tzu writes:

> “There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard. 
> </n>
> There are not more than five primary colours, yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever been seen.
> </n>
> There are not more than five cardinal tastes, yet combinations of them yield more flavours than can ever be tasted.”
