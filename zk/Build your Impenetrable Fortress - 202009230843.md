# Build your Impenetrable Fortress
#mental-health 

When you practice [[Habit Bundling - 202008271241]], [[Context-Sharing Habits - 202008271242]], etc., practices in life become second nature - capable of being called upon at will. This is a skill that can pay itself in dividends later down the road when life gets difficult. When this positive feedback loop is created - the mind's practices benefit the mind's practices - the training will be incredibly worth it. 

> “Remember that your ruling reason becomes unconquerable when it rallies and relies on itself, so that it won’t do anything contrary to its own will, even if its position is irrational. How much more unconquerable if its judgments are careful and made rationally? Therefore, the mind freed from passions is an impenetrable fortress—a person has no more secure place of refuge for all time."
> - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.48

The growth of this fortress is exponential as marginal gains build up on each other. In fact, small gains every day explode into incredible improvements over time!
