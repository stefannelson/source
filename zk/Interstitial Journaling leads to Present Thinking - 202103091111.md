# Interstitial Journaling leads to Present Thinking
#mental-health 

The basic idea of Interstitial journaling is to write out entries throughout the day, recording the timestamp of when this was done. The content of these could be anything, be it how I'm feeling emotionally, things that happened, planning ahead, etc. This method leads into a habit of continual check-ins, being conscious of what's going on around me.

This way of writing notes is a stellar way of not only keeping me in the present moment, but realizing how much my emotions fluctuate from literally minute to minute. Generalizing a day as "Wow, Monday sucked" would be doing a disservice.
