# Differentiating Writing from Research
#writing #productivity 

Research in a system such as the one I'm writing in right now has a benefit of instilling a habit of creating a bunch of nodes between ideas. For this one, for example, I want to look for notes that involve describing an Atomic Notes structure and linking them in-text or down under. As I make more notes in the future, this note may gain more and more connections. 

This is all part of the research process. I am writing for the sake of putting new information into the system, and any projects that utilize this information are their own thing. Thus, while I am technically "writing" during this research process, it is to get chunks from sources (linked below) into a form that is in my own words. 

The writing process itself gets helped along by looking at the graph view of all of my notes, seeing where connections lead and if they can be implemented into the current project.
