This repository contains my writing and research in a Zettelkasten-esque format (backlinks, comparmentalized notes, etc). Whenever I come across something interesting, it goes into one of the folders listed below **in my own words** to facilitate learning [^1]: 

* `concept`: usually technical, scientific, and/or mathematical ideas.
* `lit`: notes I take on books. Ideas developed here typically transition to one of the other directories.
* `zk`: compartmentized ideas that are typically more than a textbook-like entry.

Locally, I do this work in the application [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a Markdown editor that supports tagging, backlinking, and visualizations of the connections stemming from each of these notes. 

[^1]: Of course, this isn't even remotely close to being set in stone. Folder ideas could change pretty drastically later on!
